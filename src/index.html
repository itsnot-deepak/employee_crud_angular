  or the app folder , basically the app folder contains the root application/component it will have its own html,component,css file
  inside of that root component and in its html file specifically we add the other components with the same class-->

<!-- there are directives in angular they are basically specially properties/ part in an normal html tag
there are two type of directives - structural and attribute 
structural directives involve - ngIf,ngFor
attribute directive involve - ngclass and ngStyle
u need to add CommonMoule in the imports before using them 
the structural attribute is used with a * in front of it 
the style and class are used simply by using the [] in the tag 


for api 
u need to go to app.config and in that register the providehttpcilent in the provider 
we made the api call using the providehttpclient , first u need to add this in this in the config file under the providers 
then u have to use the inject(httpclient) line to create an instance of the class httpclient then u need to make an function for the 
specfic api call since here it is getting the roles we make the a new method dor the api call here 
in this method we use the http.get to get the api and then we use the subscribe method to get whatever is returend back 


the api call made is aysncrohous , meaning different parts of the code are run and the code doesn't wait for the response
when the response function come the subscribe handles it and then using the arrow function the rolelist is updated

the functin is called in oninit function the oninit function is an interface and is implemented here 
it performs whatever is there in it when the button is pressed or whenever the role html document is accessed 

normally the api call is not done in the component 
usually the api are not used like this they are used using the services 

services 

it is a class that contains all the functions that are going to be used thruout the project and also for reuseable fuctions 

to make an service we use the ng g s _servicename_ command in the services folder which is present in the app folder and then 
we go into the ts file , here we have an injectable instead of an component , so this injectable is just like the decorator for the service
then we create an instance of the http client either by the constructor or by the function inject 
then we make an function in this master service by the name of get designation , this function basicaly calls the api and returns the data
here instead of making it any data type  we are going to make this as an interface which has the name apirespone , this interface can be used by
any component that uses the api 

so the reason to make this thing called as service instead of the normal way of calling the api into the component is because of reuseabilty 
and ease of doing , when we make an service any component that has to use the api they can simple just import/inject that service into their component 
this reduces all the work of changing the api everywhere if there is any change somewhere 


now coming back to the function in the service this function is used to call the api and this function returns an observable 

what is an observable , it is a data stream that give data at differnt times , imagine this like a youtube channel that uploads
videos time to time , now to see /be updated about the videos we need to subscribe to that channel in an similar way 

to get data from that data stream /api we need to subscribe to it which u can see is done in the designation component under the ngoninit



let us also talk about the decorators here for a second , see the appcomponent for that 


interfaces - see the interface/role.ts file 

routes are mentioned in the approutes.ts file go there to see more
for the routes to work we need to add the routeroutlet tag 

we have routerlink that can be used instead of href and is prefred to use intead of the href
it is present in tags and to see u can go to app.html file , in that we need to add the /link
to use this import the routerlink module in the import 

routerlink active instead of using the bootstrap -acitve we can use the routerlinkactive to highlight the 
link that is active to do that we set routerlinkactive="active" and to use this also what we do is import the module



Class vs interface 

interface are only present in the typescript during the compile time there is nothing like interface because js doesn't have the interface 
interface must be used only when we  need to define the structure for the type 

classes are used when we use form/ this is done beacuse an instance of them can be created and also they can have default values 
for the properties in them 

classes can also be used to make methods in them 

you can see the use of the class in the client component and corresponding class in the class folder 


--api division for ease--
because mostly the url for the api are same we can make an environment folder 
we use the command ng g environments 
this command updates the angular.json file and adds this in the file 
we put the common part of the api in the environment 
there are two constant files in the environments folder , one is the basic .ts file the other one is the developer.ts file 
sometimes we have different api for development and normal so we can keep them separated for now add the api common part in the 
API_URl variable(make it if not there)
and whereever the api is called using the get/post/put/etc commands u need to write environment.API_URL+"the api part u have different"
